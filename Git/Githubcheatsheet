From VScode
1) Initialize repository on Github -> follow the instructions (git init ve slozce -> ve vscode commit all -> git remote blabla 
   -> git remote push (?))
   
2) From github create repo, create a new file, put readme on -> commit -> edit, save and see changes in history.

3) branching - by default everything is on a master (root of a tree), but I can switch to another branch by creating is 
   under insights and network we can see the graph of our tree 
   
4) when I have different branches I can merge them together (merge button) 

5) To fork a repository means take someone elses repository a put it into your account - you don't have to ask
   permitions when doing changes etc.
   Pull request is when I come up with someting I really like while working on fork and want the original creator to 
   merge it with the main master
   
6) Issues - you can ask questions about things in a project/report bugs/typos, etc.

7) Cloning is action of taking a repository from the internet a "downloading" it into your computer
   just type: git clone "url goes here"
   git status tells me the status...
   push is act of sending to github, pull is act of getting from github
